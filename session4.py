# Operators

# Python operators

# 1. Arthimetic operator

# Used to perform common math operations

# + - Addition - A+B
# - - Subtraction - A-B
# * - Multiplication - A*B
# / - Division - A/B
# % - Moudlus - A%B
# ** - Exponentation - A**B
# // - Floor Division - A//B


# 2. Assignment operator

# Used to assign values to a variable

# = -> a = 5
# += -> a = a + 10 -> a += 10
# -= -> a -= 10
# *= -- /=
# :=  --> print(x := 10)

print(x := 10)
print(f'The value stored inside x is {x}')


# 3. Comaprision operator - Gives out a boolean value as the result

# Used to compare two values

# == - Equal - x == y
# != - Not equal  - x != y
# > - greater than - x > y
# < - less than - x < y
# >= Greater than or equal to - x >= y
# <= Less than or equal to - x <= y


# 4. Logical operator

# Used to combine conditional statements

# a = 10
# b = 20
# c = 30

# x - a > b - False
# y - c > b - True


# and - x and y -> False
# or - x or y -> True
# not - not(x) - True  -- not(y) - False

# Identity operators

# used to comapre the objects - if they are actually same
# is 
# is not


# Membership operator

# used to test if a sequence is presented in the object
#  in
#  not in

# Bitwise operator

# used to perform binary operations

# & - AND
# | - OR
# ^ - XOR
# ~ - NOT

# >> - Zero left shift
# << - Signed rioght shift
